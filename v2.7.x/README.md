# SOF-2.7 prebuilt binaries for Intel Meteor Lake hardware

## Requirements

### Linux Kernel

These prebuilt binaries use the new SOF IPC4 host interface
and thus a recent Linux kernel version is required. At least
Linux 6.5 or newer kernel revision is recommended.

## Installing the SOF binaries

Use the install script at sof-bin/install.sh to install
the binaries on your system (or follow the manual instructions
described in the install.sh file).
